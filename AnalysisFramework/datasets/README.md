# Datasets

The datasets we were working with can be obtained from this link [https://web.archive.org/web/20180127221309/https://databases.today/search-nojs.php](https://web.archive.org/web/20180127221309/https://databases.today/search-nojs.php).

The dataset `weak_dataset.txt` was zipped using application [7z](https://www.7-zip.org/), before use you need to unzip the file `weak_dataset.7z` by using command:

```bash
$ 7z x weak_dataset.7z
```
