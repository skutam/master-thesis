# Master thesis

This program is a result of my master-thesis. It is split into two parts. The `AnalysisFramework`
that can analyse datasets and the `PasswordChecker` that is again divided
into two parts `Reactive` and `Proactive` password checker. These tools are
used for validating the passwords. More can be found in `README.md` in their
folder. The folder `Latex` contains the text of thesis written in Latex. The
`Master thesis.pdf` is the compiled latex in `Latex` folder.
